\description{
Provides access to the US Census Bureau batch endpoints for locations and geographies.
The function has been developed specifically with large data sets in mind. only unique
addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique
addresses, it will be automatically subset into appropriately sized API calls,
geocoded, and then put back together so that a single object is returned.
The function implements iteration and optional parallelization in order to geocode datasets
larger than the API limit of 10,000 and more efficiently than sending 10,000 per request.
The function therefore provides an efficient solution to batch geocoding via the Census Bureauâ€™s services.
This implementation assumes that your data are contained in a data.frame or tibble, and that address
data are split into a number of component variables: street address, city, state, and five digit zip code.
